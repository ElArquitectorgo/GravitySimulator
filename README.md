# N-body simulation in C
A particle system simulation using gravitational force and collision detection.

## Optimization
- Quadtrees
- Barnes-Hut Algorithm

## Controls

- Press left click to generate particles.
- Press 'k' to see the QuadTree boundaries
- Right click and drag to generate an accelerated particle.
- Use MouseWheel to zoom.
- Use keys 'a', 'w', 's', 'd' for movement.

Thanks to William Y. Feng, this code is based on its implementation:
